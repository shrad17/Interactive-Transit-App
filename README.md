This is the project of Information Interaction Design class. It is basically mobile application finding shuttles in NYC.
This shuttles are mostly belongs to any community(i.e., chinese shuttles, maxican shuttles), but it is open to general public of New York city. They are very cheap and time savers, so for letting user use easy option we aimed to create this app.
We worked on user research by arranging contextual inquiry (interviews + surveys), which helped us to come up with affinity diagram and rough idea of application. Then, we sketched ideas on paper and prepared hi-fi wireframes and prototypes.
